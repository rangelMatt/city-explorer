Journal Entry: Slowly I am understanding how the parent/child are communicating with eachother. Accessing each property is coming along ok. I am going to have to take some time at looking how this is taking shape over the weekend. The presentation on the code review helped out *immensely*. Will be looking at the white board and reviewing the video from today.
Specificaly forms, these made total sense and so did the filtering. Again, it was just how to have the paths connect to eachother that I am hitting a wall one. I am **ALMOST** there.
